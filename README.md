# 2017-WNBA-SQL-Project
In this project I analyzed the players and teams metrics of the 2017 WNBA season using SQL. As a fan of the league since 2016 my favorite players are Candace Parker and Maya Moore. In this project you will see what the WNBA is numerically comprised of. With the league reaching new heights in 2024 its amazing to see how the game has grown over time. 

For a more visual representation of stats of the 2017 WNBA you can also check out my Tableau dashboard I attached
